Incomplete remnants of a larger project preserved for reference

## Summary

In college, I had a lab where, in groups of three we spent the first few weeks creating the basis of what would eventually become the term project, a small vehicle capable of performing a few prescribed tasks. At the time, I had no real concept of git, Github, and how useful they would have been to us. This is all that I seem to have saved from the project. By uploading it here, I no longer have to worry about losing track of what's left.
